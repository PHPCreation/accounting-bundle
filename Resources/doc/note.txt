This bundle need to be able to let us manage transaction like an accounting system.


Account(or ledger term need to be determine) Manager:
- create account
- retrive sum by account
- retrive sum by account for a period of date (starting date optional)


Transaction
- get transaction by tag
- get transaction
- validate (check if sum on entries = 0)


Questions:
- Account or Transaction or Entry is tagged ?
    ex. if we tag account, we will need to create multiple accounts for a customer.
    ex. if we tag transaction, we will need to get transaction for appling filters.
    ex. if we tag entries, for report we can filter directly by account and/or tags
